2000 Billboard Chart Analysis

The Question: When are the most popular songs of a year released? When do they rise to the top of the charts?


The Data:
Here is the top part of our data:

and now we sort by date peaked

Hypothesis: On average, the most longevity on the charts will be released late Spring/ early Summer and peak in Summer.

Method: Compare how many top songs are released each month and which month songs peak.

Results:


Top Songs by Release Month

Discussion: Clearly these graphs disprove my Hypothesis. What they show is that most songs tend to peak in the Winter rather than the Summer.

This does not make immediate sense intuitively. Summer is usually when all the earbugs for the year are born and continue through the Fall. But as the data shows, there is clear evidence to the contrary.

Winter is full of Christmas songs that come back year after year and dominate play time on the radio, which is how these songs are gauged at "top".

Top Three Months for Songs to Peak

As the above diagram shows, the top month for songs to peak was January, followed by December, and then a tier lower by September.

As a followup, I investigated how a songs rise to the top actually goes. The table below illustrates six songs picked at random from the list. The chart tracks the songs position from release to the end of the time represented in the data.

What is interesting about this is that it shows each song rise up to a place of prominence on the chart, then fall back down until finally rising back up and riding the top of the chart for weeks.

To better illustrate and remove some clutter. Here is the path that a single song takes to the top. Notice the rise, fall, and rise again in the curve.

Perhaps this initial rise takes place in the months leading up to Fall and Winter thus allowing the songs to that became familiar over the summer to become staples of radio play come winter.
